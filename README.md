## who i am 🎯

**security program manager and technical leader building implementation skills.**

i coordinate security programs, manage risk frameworks, and build operational tools. my background: emergency response coordination, cost modeling, compliance frameworks. got my CS degree to understand systems deeply enough to lead technical teams and make informed architecture decisions.

**degrees:** MS Computer Science + MPH  
**current role:** security program management, GRC, project coordination  
**building:** technical credibility through hands-on development and cloud architecture knowledge

**approach:** heavy AI user for efficiency—leveraging LLMs for development, documentation, research. building skills to lead technical teams, not necessarily to be a full-time engineer.

---

## what i bring to organizations 💼

### **program management & leadership** (current strength)

**security program coordination:**
- manage security initiatives from requirements to deployment
- coordinate across technical and non-technical stakeholders
- track budgets, resources, and timelines
- translate technical security to business risk and ROI

**GRC & compliance:**
- policy development and regulatory frameworks
- risk assessment and mitigation planning
- understanding NIST, ISO 27001, HIPAA compliance requirements
- preparing for CISSP (governance/risk/compliance)

**operational excellence:**
- background in emergency response coordination (public health)
- built Mission Ready Package cost models for crisis deployments
- strong at resource allocation, cost tracking, stakeholder communication
- proven ability to manage complex projects under pressure

**business intelligence & automation:**
- Power BI and Qlik Sense dashboards for security metrics
- Oracle APEX applications for cost and vendor management
- PowerApps workflows for operational efficiency
- SAS programming for risk modeling and statistical analysis

---

## why technical skills matter 🚀

**the goal isn't to become a security engineer—it's to be a more effective technical leader.**

```python
leadership_development = {
    "current_capabilities": {
        "manage": "security programs, budgets, teams, compliance",
        "communicate": "technical risk to executives and boards",
        "coordinate": "cross-functional initiatives and deployments"
    },
    
    "adding_technical_depth": {
        "cloud_architecture": "Oracle Multicloud Architect (2025) - understand enterprise cloud design",
        "security_implementation": "hands-on labs (TryHackMe) - credibility with technical teams",
        "development_skills": "Python, automation - build tools when needed",
        "AI_ML_understanding": "Kaggle, ML fundamentals - lead AI security initiatives"
    },
    
    "end_goal": {
        "role": "security leadership that combines strategic vision with technical credibility",
        "examples": ["Director of Security", "CISO track", "Security Program Director"],
        "value": "can set technical direction AND manage programs/people/budgets",
        "differentiator": "not purely technical, not purely managerial - both"
    }
}
```

**why this matters:**
- **Lead technical teams with credibility**: Engineers respect leaders who understand implementation
- **Make informed architecture decisions**: Don't just rely on others' recommendations
- **Evaluate tools and solutions**: Understand what you're buying and why
- **Build when needed**: Create tools to solve operational problems
- **Future-proof career**: Technical + leadership skills = senior security leadership

## what you'll find here 📁

**this GitHub showcases technical implementation skills for leadership roles.**

not trying to become a full-time engineer—building credibility to lead technical teams and make informed decisions.

**projects focus on:**
- **Security operations tools** → solve real PM problems with code
- **Automation scripts** → eliminate manual work
- **GRC tools** → make compliance manageable
- **Cloud security labs** → understand enterprise architecture
- **AI security experiments** → lead AI initiatives

each project demonstrates: *"I understand this deeply enough to lead teams building it at scale."*

## how i work 🧠

### **AI-powered efficiency**

daily AI user for:
- **Strategy & research**: quickly synthesize frameworks, best practices, vendor comparisons
- **Development acceleration**: prototype tools faster while learning fundamentals
- **Documentation**: generate policies, procedures, technical docs
- **Team enablement**: help others leverage AI for productivity

not replacing understanding with AI—using AI to move faster while building real knowledge.

### **leadership approach**

from emergency management:
- coordinate complex programs across multiple teams and organizations
- communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- balance security requirements with operational constraints
- build frameworks that teams actually follow
- manage under pressure and uncertainty

applying to security:
- lead security programs that deliver business value
- make technical decisions informed by hands-on understanding
- evaluate vendors and solutions with technical depth
- build or buy strategically based on organizational needs
